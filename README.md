# Concepts in Object Oriented Programming

## Class

- Template (blueprint) for the creation of an object

### Attribute (parameter) 

- Descriptions of an object. (First name, last name, class, etc.)
- Two different types of attributes:
- Instance attribute (applies to a specific instance)
- Class level attribute (applies to every object within a class)
